    "title": "Binary black holes merging from active galactic nuclei",
    "excerpt":"This project investigates how black holes embedded in AGN disks can grow through repeated mergers, and how gas interactions — particularly gas hardening — can shape their properties. The study contrasts two models: one with gas hardening (GH), where the gas facilitates orbital decay of binaries, and one without it (no-GH), where mergers proceed solely due to gravitational wave (GW) emission.   Scientific Context: Black Hole Growth in AGN Disks   Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galactic centers are often surrounded by dense gaseous disks. These active galactic nuclei (AGN) can host populations of stellar-origin black holes that sink toward special regions known as migration traps. Within these traps, black holes can interact and merge, sometimes repeatedly, leading to hierarchical mergers that build up intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs).   Key scientific goals of this work include:      Understanding the role of gas torques and orbital damping in black hole mergers.   Quantifying the impact of gas hardening on the mass and spin distribution of resulting binaries.   Comparing AGN-driven mergers with other formation channels (e.g., young star clusters, globular clusters, isolated binaries).     Gas Hardening vs. No Gas Hardening: Two Evolutionary Scenarios   Two physical models are considered:      Gas Hardening (GH): The gas surrounding binaries extracts angular momentum and energy, significantly speeding up the inspiral. This promotes multiple merger generations and efficient spin alignment.   No Gas Hardening: Mergers rely only on gravitational radiation. Fewer hierarchical events occur, and remnant spins remain isotropically distributed.     Comparing AGN Mergers to Other Astrophysical Channels   To understand whether black hole (BH) mergers occurring in AGN disks are truly distinct, the authors systematically compared their results to four other formation scenarios. This comparison was carried out using BBlack, a statistical tool that allows Bayesian inference of the contribution (or mixing fraction) of each channel based on gravitational-wave data.      Explore BBlack Tool →     What Are the Competing Formation Channels?   Besides the AGN disk scenario, four environments were modeled consistently using the same population synthesis framework (sevn) and astrophysical assumptions:      Young Star Clusters (YSC): Compact clusters of newly formed stars where dynamical interactions between massive remnants are frequent.   Globular Clusters (GC): Dense, old stellar systems that can retain black holes and facilitate repeated mergers over time.   Nuclear Star Clusters (NSC): Stellar systems surrounding supermassive black holes, similar to the centers of galaxies.   Isolated Binaries: Binary stars evolving without dynamical interactions, where black holes form and merge solely through stellar evolution and gravitational radiation.   These environments differ in density, metallicity, and dynamical conditions, which all influence the mass, spin, and rate of BH mergers.     Mass Distributions and Channel Fingerprints        The AGN disk with gas hardening (GH) stands out sharply from the other channels. In this model, black holes can undergo multiple successive mergers, leading to very high final masses — up to ~5,000 solar masses. This is well beyond the range achievable by the other channels:      Dynamical channels (YSC, GC, NSC) typically produce primary black holes up to a few hundred solar masses, with one or two mass peaks around 20–50 M☉.   Isolated binaries are more limited, with primary BHs rarely exceeding ~50 M☉ due to supernova mass loss and pair-instability constraints.   The no-GH AGN model produces a mass spectrum much more similar to NSCs or GCs, where the hierarchical chain is typically truncated after 2–3 mergers.     Quantifying the Contribution of Each Channel   Using BBlack, I analyzed 56 high-purity gravitational wave events from the LVK catalog (GWTC-3) and inferred the relative contribution of each formation channel (called mixing fractions).      The key conclusions are:      NSC and YSC channels dominate the observed population due to their ability to produce mergers in the 10–40 M☉ range, which is where most current detections lie.   The isolated binary channel is disfavored because it predicts too few systems with high spin and mass.   The AGN+GH channel, while unique in producing extremely massive systems, contributes little to the currently detectable sample — simply because those massive mergers emit at frequencies below the sensitivity range of current detectors like LIGO and Virgo.   The AGN+no-GH scenario overlaps substantially with NSCs and GCs and is thus hard to distinguish observationally.      In other words, gas hardening in AGN disks leaves a unique imprint on the mass distribution of merging black holes, but confirming its role will likely require future detectors sensitive to lower gravitational-wave frequencies (such as the Einstein Telescope or LISA).           Summary  This study highlights the critical role of gas dynamics in the evolution of black holes within AGN disks:      Gas hardening enhances the number and mass of hierarchical mergers.   It leads to high spin alignment, producing effective spin distributions peaking near 1.   The AGN+GH channel stands out for creating extremely massive black holes, offering a potential explanation for some gavitational-wave sources in the mass gap or beyond.   Next-generation detectors will be essential to test these predictions and differentiate between competing formation channels.

    "title": "Black Holes & Gravitational Waves",
    "excerpt":"Black Hole Formation and the Puzzle of Mass and Time   Black holes are among the most enigmatic objects in the universe. They are born from the gravitational collapse of massive stars or through the mergers of compact objects. Today, they are observed through two main channels: electromagnetic observations (e.g. X-rays, radio jets, active galactic nuclei) and gravitational-wave detections, which have opened a new window on their formation and evolution.   Stellar Evolution and the Birth of Black Holes   The formation of a black hole is tightly connected to the initial mass and metallicity (chemical composition) of the progenitor star. Metallicity influences how much mass a star loses through stellar winds during its lifetime — a key factor in determining the mass of the resulting black hole:      Low-metallicity stars lose little mass and are more likely to collapse into massive or intermediate-mass black holes.   High-metallicity stars, on the other hand, shed a significant fraction of their mass through strong winds, often resulting in lighter black holes or even neutron stars.   Metallicity also encodes cosmic time: it increases with each generation of stars as heavy elements are synthesized and dispersed by supernovae.   The first generation of stars, known as Population III (Pop III) stars, formed in a pristine, metal-free Universe, roughly 200 to 500 million years after the Big Bang, corresponding to a redshift of z ≈ 20–10. Their unique composition led to extremely massive stellar bodies (typically 100–300 M☉, possibly more), with weak stellar winds and minimal mass loss. When these stars died, many are believed to have collapsed directly into black holes with masses ranging from 100 to 1000 M☉, placing them in the category of intermediate-mass black holes. These objects are prime candidates for the seeds of future supermassive black holes.   Later generations of stars, known as Population I and II (Pop I/II) stars, formed as the Universe became progressively enriched in heavy elements from earlier stellar explosions. Pop II stars began forming around redshift z ≈ 10–6 (~500 Myr to 1 Gyr after the Big Bang), while Pop I stars dominate from z ≈ 2 to the present (the last ~10 billion years). These younger stars, with higher metallicity, exhibit stronger stellar winds and follow different evolutionary paths, generally leading to lighter black hole remnants.   An additional layer of complexity arises with very massive stars due to the pair-instability process:      Stars with helium core masses between ~64 and 135 M☉ are thought to undergo pair-instability supernovae, which lead to total disruption of the star, leaving behind no remnant black hole.   This phenomenon creates a predicted mass gap in the black hole mass spectrum, between approximately 50 and 120 M☉. Finding black holes in this range could challenge existing models of stellar evolution, particularly those involving Pop III progenitors in the early Universe.   Observational Landscape   Current observations reveal a wide variety of black holes:      Stellar-mass black holes (5–100 M☉), primarily detected via gravitational waves or X-ray binaries;   Intermediate-mass black holes (100–3.10\\(^5\\) M☉), for which evidence remains sparse and debated;   Massive black holes (3.10\\(^5\\)–10¹⁰ M☉), observed in galactic centers across the universe, even at high redshifts (z &gt; 6).          Parameter space of observed black holes from electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations (mass vs redshift).   This landscape raises two fundamental questions:           How can such massive black holes form so early in cosmic history?  Supermassive black holes have been observed less than a billion years after the Big Bang, but standard stellar evolution models struggle to explain their rapid growth.            Why do we observe a “mass gap” in the intermediate-mass range?  While stellar-mass and supermassive black holes are well established, the population between ~100 and 10⁴ solar masses is largely uncharted. Is this due to detection limits, or does it reflect a genuine lack of formation pathways?       Addressing these questions requires new observational tools — and this is where gravitational waves play a key role.   Studies on Binary black holes formation and evolutions                                                                                                                       Binary Black holes from Globular cluster                                                    This project investigates how the internal dynamics and long-term evolution of globular clusters shape the mass, spin, and merger-rate distributions of black holes through repeated mergers.

Learn more                                          Gravitational-Wave Observations of Black Hole Mergers   Gravitational waves (GWs) provide a direct probe of compact binary mergers, allowing us to observe black holes that would otherwise remain invisible. These signals are rich in astrophysical information and can be studied both individually and collectively.   Each binary black hole coalescence emits gravitational waves in three phases:      Inspiral: the two black holes orbit each other, gradually losing energy via gravitational radiation. This phase encodes precise information about their masses and spins.   Merger: the black holes collide and form a single, highly deformed object.   Ringdown: the remnant settles into a stable black hole, emitting GWs at characteristic frequencies (quasi-normal modes).          There are two main observables from GW data:   1. Individual Merger Events   Individual mergers are detected through matched filtering, where a bank of theoretical waveforms is compared to the detector data. This method allows us to estimate the properties of each event (mass, spin, redshift, orientation) with high accuracy. Since the first detection in 2015 (GW150914), dozens of binary black hole mergers have been observed, providing constraints on black hole populations, formation channels, and cosmology.   2. The Astrophysical Gravitational-Wave Background   In addition to isolated events, the universe is filled with the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) — the superposition of countless unresolved mergers across cosmic history. This signal cannot be detected in a single detector. Instead, it is extracted statistically via cross-correlation between detectors in a network (e.g., LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, Einstein Telescope).          Typical background from a population of binary black holes with masses around 40 M☉ and redshifts of 14 ± 4. One can distinguish the different phases of the coalescence through the characteristic shape of the spectrum.   The SGWB offers a unique window into:      The merger rate history of compact binaries;   Populations that are too faint or distant to resolve individually;   Early-universe phenomena, such as the first generations of stars (Population III).   Together, these observations — from discrete signals to background noise — provide a comprehensive picture of black hole formation, growth, and distribution across space and time.

    "excerpt":"On this page, I present my contributions to the Einstein Telescope collaboration.  The content is structured around two main research efforts, each corresponding to a peer-reviewed publication:           Science with the Einstein Telescope: a comparison of different designs  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023JCAP…07..068B/abstract            The Science of the Einstein Telescope  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2025arXiv250312263A/abstract       These studies explore how different detector configurations impact the scientific potential of the Einstein Telescope, particularly in relation to gravitational-wave backgrounds and astrophysical source populations.   Einstein Telescope – Design Impact on astrophysical background detection   On this section, I present my contributions to the design impact study of the Einstein Telescope and the resulting predictions for future scientific observations.   What is the Einstein Telescope?   The Einstein Telescope (ET) is a European initiative to build a third-generation gravitational wave detector in Europe. As of the time this work was written, three sites are under consideration to host the observatory: Sardinia in Italy, Limburg in the Netherlands, and Saxony in Germany.   Multiple designs are currently under study. Here, I focus on the most realistic and widely discussed options, from both technological and financial perspectives.   Detector Designs   The baseline design currently favored by the scientific community features a triangular configuration: three underground arms forming an equilateral triangle, each arm being 10 or 15 km long. At each corner lies the intersection of two interferometers: one optimized for high frequencies, the other for low frequencies. The entire structure would be located 250–300 meters underground.   An alternative design proposes two underground L-shaped interferometers (similar to LIGO), each with 15 or 20 km arms. These would be oriented either parallel (0°) or at an angle (45°) to each other.   Each configuration brings its own scientific advantages and technological challenges.   The simulations and predictions presented below were produced using my custom analysis tool, Princess.   Cost-Benefit Analysis (CoBA)   Since 2021, I have been involved in the ET design community, contributing to the evaluation of how different configurations and arm lengths affect the detection of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background.   These results were published in a collaborative article with a large author list:  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023JCAP…07..068B/abstract   Using state-of-the-art models, I predicted the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from three types of compact binary systems:      Binary black holes (BBH)   Binary neutron stars (BNS)   Mixed systems of black hole and neutron star (BHNS)   The contributions of these three populations to the gravitational-wave background are shown in the figure below. The parabolic curves represent the sensitivities of various detector configurations — specifically, the triangle configuration with 10 or 15 km arms, and the double-L configuration with 20 km arms (either aligned or misaligned).          Gravitational-wave background predictions for BBH, BNS, and BHNS systems. The parabolic curves represent the sensitivities of different Einstein Telescope configurations: the triangular design (10 km and 15 km arms), and two 20 km L-shaped interferometers, aligned (0°) or misaligned (45°).   Scientific Challenges and Goals   This study highlights three major scientific challenges for Einstein Telescope in the context of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background:      Detecting the first generation of black holes (Population III)   Disentangling black hole formation channels, using binary black hole observations in connection with the star formation history   Observing the residual gravitational-wave background from binary neutron star mergers   The figure below summarizes these three challenges in the frequency–amplitude parameter space, illustrating which detector designs are best suited to address them.          Design-dependent sensitivity curves and parameter-space locations of key scientific targets.   From this analysis, we can draw several conclusions:      For detecting Population III black holes, the double-L configuration with aligned arms (0°) is preferred. This configuration provides the best sensitivity in the frequency band where the Population III signal is expected to peak.   In contrast, for higher-frequency challenges — such as discriminating between formation channels and observing binary neutron star mergers — the triangular configuration offers better sensitivity beyond 120 Hz.     This comparative study helps inform the design decisions for the Einstein Telescope by linking technical choices to their scientific impact.   Beyond Design: What the Einstein Telescope Can Tell Us About the Universe   In addition to evaluating detector design, I also contributed to a broader collaborative study exploring the full scientific potential of the Einstein Telescope. My work focused on two key questions related to the astrophysical gravitational-wave background (SGWB):      What can we learn about the formation channels of binary black holes (BBH)?   How can we identify gravitational waves from the first stars — the so-called Population III?   These studies are essential for interpreting the SGWB, which is expected to carry rich information about compact object populations that are too distant or too faint to resolve individually.   Understanding BBH Formation Channels          A major component of the SGWB in the Einstein Telescope will come from binary black hole mergers with masses between ~10 and 1,000 solar masses, and redshifts below 5. These black holes can form through several channels, grouped into two main families:      Isolated channel: binaries evolve from massive stellar pairs in isolation, often in the field (Field channel).   Dynamical channel: binaries form through interactions in dense stellar environments, such as globular clusters (GC), young star clusters (YSC), or nuclear star clusters (NSC). Other scenarios include gas-rich environments like active galactic nuclei (AGN).   Each channel leaves a distinct imprint on the black holes’ masses, spins, and orbital properties. These differences affect both the rate of mergers and the spectral shape of the SGWB.   In the study, we modeled the SGWB contributions from the Field, YSC, NSC, and GC channels using the PRINCESS code and population models from the literature. The analysis included both the total background and the residual background — the latter obtained by subtracting individually detectable sources (with SNR &gt; 20), simulating realistic data processing by the ET.   The figure below (from the original publication) shows how each formation channel contributes to the SGWB, including uncertainties in merger rates. Notably, the frequency where the SGWB deviates from a simple power-law carries information about the minimal black hole mass and redshift distribution for each formation channel.   Probing the First Stars: Population III Remnants          Population III stars — the first generation of stars formed in the early universe — are also expected to contribute to the SGWB. Their black hole remnants are believed to be more massive and to merge at higher redshifts compared to later stellar populations (Pop I/II). This results in a gravitational-wave background that deviates from the typical power-law at lower frequencies.   Our study used population models from the literature to estimate both the total and residual SGWB from Pop III black holes. Even though their overall contribution is predicted to be weaker (due to low merger rates), detecting this background would provide unique constraints on the early universe.   However, identifying a residual Pop III signal is extremely challenging. Its detection relies on:      Accurate subtraction of individually detectable Pop I/II signals.   Excellent low-frequency sensitivity of the Einstein Telescope.   Improved modeling of merger rates and mass distributions for Pop III stars.   Even if a clear detection remains out of reach, the SGWB observed by ET can place upper limits on high-redshift black hole mergers, offering indirect evidence for early star formation scenarios.

    "excerpt":"To introduce my research work, I present it through three broader, popular-science-oriented sections. These allow a general contextualization of the scientific projects I have had the pleasure of conducting throughout my career. You will find three main topics:      Gravitational waves and their detection   The origin of black holes   (Upcoming content)   This first page is dedicated to gravitational waves, offering an overview of the field and introducing my related research projects.     A Brief Historical Introduction   Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime that propagate at the speed of light. They are a direct consequence of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, formulated in 1915 in two foundational papers:     “On the General Theory of Relativity”   “The Field Equations of Gravitation”   The first publication explicitly describing gravitational waves—“Über Gravitationswellen” (1918)—appeared three years later.     Abstract of the original 1918 article by Albert Einstein   In 1974, Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor discovered the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16—two orbiting stellar remnants, one of which is a pulsar emitting regular light pulses. In 1979, after four years of observation, they demonstrated that the orbital decay of the system matched the predictions of general relativity, thus confirming the existence of gravitational waves indirectly (1979 publication). They were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993.  A 2016 update to this work is available here.     Orbital decay of the binary pulsar system. Red points are measurements, closely matching the theoretical curve predicted by general relativity.   The first direct detection of gravitational waves occurred in 2015—exactly 100 years after general relativity. Using the LIGO detectors, scientists observed the merger of two black holes (29 and 36 solar masses).  (Original paper)   In 2017, the Virgo detector in Europe joined the LIGO network, enabling triangulation of gravitational wave sources. On August 17, 2017, the network observed the merger of two neutron stars, simultaneously with electromagnetic signals, marking the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy.     Detection paper   Multi-messenger analysis   The foundational detection (GW150914) was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.   As of 2025, the global network includes four detectors: two in the U.S. (LIGO), one in Italy (Virgo), and one in Japan (KAGRA). Together, they have recorded over 100 black hole mergers, enriching our understanding of the universe’s structure and evolution.     Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors   At the time of writing, four operational ground-based interferometers exist:      LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford (USA) – each with 4 km-long arms   Virgo (Italy) – 3 km-long arms   KAGRA (Japan) – a 3 km-long underground interferometer      How These Detectors Work   Gravitational waves slightly stretch and squeeze spacetime. On Earth, this is measured using giant Michelson interferometers with kilometer-scale arms. The principle involves detecting phase shifts in laser beams bouncing between mirrors at the ends of the arms. A passing wave causes a tiny differential change in path length, producing interference patterns that can be measured.                 Click the image to watch the explicative video on YouTube    Operating Point of an Interferometer   Interferometers are tuned to operate on a dark fringe, meaning destructive interference cancels the signal at the output. This requires real-time feedback control of mirror positions to maintain stability.  In this section, I present my research on modeling and simulating these feedback control loops to keep the interferometer at its operating point.    Explore Noise Analysis    The Future of Ground-Based Detectors   Two major next-generation projects are currently underway:   Cosmic Explorer (USA)   The Cosmic Explorer collaboration proposes building two new interferometers with arm lengths of 20 to 40 km, dramatically improving sensitivity. This would allow detection of nearly all compact binary mergers in the observable universe.  🔗 Cosmic Explorer website  🖼️ Insert CE image here   Einstein Telescope (Europe)   Europe is preparing the Einstein Telescope (ET), possibly built at one or two sites. Multiple design and location options are still under study.  My work explores the scientific impact of design choices on compact binary detection rates and broader scientific potential.     ET official site   Design impact study (2023)   ET Blue Book (2025)    Explore Science with ET     Pulsar Timing Arrays   Another method of detecting gravitational waves is by monitoring millisecond pulsars. These highly regular signals can exhibit arrival time delays if spacetime is distorted by a passing gravitational wave. By comparing dozens of pulsars, it’s possible to reveal such distortions.   In June 2023, the NANOGrav collaboration announced evidence of a gravitational wave background, possibly generated by supermassive black hole binaries or a population of such systems.  🔗 NANOGrav discovery paper     Space-Based Interferometers   LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is an ambitious project led by ESA in collaboration with NASA.  It will consist of three spacecraft placed in a triangle formation orbiting around the Lagrange Point L2, with arms stretching 2.5 million kilometers. This enables exploration of low-frequency gravitational waves, inaccessible from the ground.     ","url": "https://pigouette.github.io/Pigouette.github.io/gravitational-waves/GW-intro"

    "title": "Hierarchical binary black holes evolution in Globular Clusters",
    "excerpt":"The Challenge: Massive Black Holes in the Gravitational-Wave Sky   One of the key open questions in gravitational-wave astronomy is the origin of black holes heavier than ~50 solar masses. The so-called pair-instability mass gap is expected to prevent black holes from forming via single-star evolution in this range. Yet, LIGO/Virgo have detected many mergers involving such massive black holes.   This project explores one promising pathway: hierarchical mergers in globular clusters (GCs). In these dense stellar environments, black holes can form binaries, merge, and the remnants can remain bound, leading to second- and third-generation mergers. This study aims to model this process and compare its imprint on observable parameters—mass, spin, and merger rate—with those of isolated binaries.     Modeling Strategy and Cluster Evolution Scenarios   We use a fast, semi-analytic model (fastcluster) to simulate the dynamics and evolution of black holes in GCs. The model accounts for:      Stellar evolution and black hole formation   Binary formation via three-body interactions   Binary hardening and gravitational-wave decay   Relativistic recoil and black hole ejection   Cluster expansion and mass loss (internal and tidal)   Three cluster evolution scenarios are considered:      NoEv: The cluster does not evolve over time.   Evol: The cluster evolves in isolation, expanding due to internal dynamics.   Tidal: The cluster is also affected by the tidal field of the host galaxy.     Three Models of Black Hole Pairing   A key uncertainty in modeling black hole binaries is how black holes pair up. This project explores three models, each making different assumptions about how black holes form binaries, particularly at later generations.   Model A     First-generation (1g) BHs pair preferentially by mass via three-body dynamics.   Only first-generation black holes are allowed as merger companions at later generations.   Model B     1g BHs are drawn from the population using a broader pairing prescription.   Secondary BHs at later generations can themselves be products of previous mergers.   Model C     Same pairing for 1g BHs as in Model B.   But, at later generations, the secondary must be a 1g BH.   These assumptions affect both the mass distribution and the number of hierarchical generations achievable before black holes are ejected from the cluster.     Mass Distributions of Merging Black Holes                  Figure above shows the primary black hole mass distribution for each model (A, B, C), compared to mergers from isolated binaries (blue) and LIGO/Virgo observations (grey shaded). Key insights:      Isolated binaries dominate at ~10 M☉, but cannot account for heavier black holes.   GC mergers (especially Models B and C) reproduce the high-mass tail (m₁ &gt; 50 M☉) through hierarchical assembly.   Model A lacks low-mass mergers due to its strict pairing rule favoring massive BHs.   The shape and slope of the high-mass end strongly depend on how black holes are allowed to combine across generations.   The models also reveal how mass ratio distributions and spin misalignments differ between GC and isolated scenarios, helping distinguish their contributions in gravitational-wave data.     Summary of Key Findings      Cluster dynamics limit hierarchical growth to 2–3 generations, with mergers beyond 3g rare due to expansion and ejection.   Models B and C produce a dual-peak mass distribution, with one peak around 10 M☉ and another around 35–40 M☉.   Hierarchical mergers dominate the high-mass tail (m₁ &gt; 50 M☉) and explain the presence of BHs in the pair-instability gap.   The mass distribution evolves with redshift, with heavier mergers more common at higher redshift (z ≳ 2), reflecting metallicity evolution.   A Bayesian mixture analysis shows that globular clusters may account for &gt;60% of observed BBH mergers, particularly when spin misalignment is included.   Spin distributions from hierarchical mergers also predict a secondary peak in precession (χₚ), which future detectors may be able to test.     Why It Matters   This work demonstrates that globular clusters are efficient factories of massive black hole mergers, especially when their internal evolution and hierarchical assembly are taken into account. It also provides concrete predictions for spin, mass, and redshift evolution that can be tested with current and future gravitational-wave observatories (e.g., LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, Einstein Telescope).   Understanding the role of globular clusters is key to decoding the full population of binary black holes—and ultimately the stellar and dynamical environments that create them.

    "title": "Noise modelisation and propagation in gravitational wave detector",
    "excerpt":"To detect gravitational waves with maximum efficiency, interferometers must be maintained at their operating point — ideally on a dark fringe — so that any deviation (from gravitational wave signals) creates detectable interference patterns at the photodiodes. This is achieved through multiple feedback control loops that stabilize the mirror positions and the input laser frequency.   However, these control systems can also serve as channels through which instrumental noise propagates within the detector. A significant part of my PhD work involved modeling these feedback loops to better understand how noise is introduced and transferred throughout the system.   Interferometer Degrees of Freedom     Representation of the interferometer, and the critical lengths.   The longitudinal control of the interferometer is based on four main degrees of freedom (DoF), which represent critical optical lengths in the system. These are:           CARM (Common Arm):  \\(CARM = \\frac{L_N + L_W}{2}\\) Controls the average length of the Fabry-Pérot arms using signal from photodiode B2.            DARM (Differential Arm):  \\(DARM = L_N - L_W\\) Key observable for gravitational waves, controlling the end mirror positions.            MICH (Michelson):  \\(MICH = l_N - l_W\\) Measures asymmetry in the short arms, extracted via photodiode B4.            PRCL (Power Recycling Cavity Length):  \\(PRCL = l_0 + \\frac{l_W + l_N}{2}\\) Coupled with MICH, also measured via B4, and used to stabilize the power recycling mirror (PRM).       These DoFs define the longitudinal control architecture.     Interferometer and Control Loop Modeling     Interferometer control scheme   The noise propagation simulation framework, called Noise Budget, includes all major subsystems:      Sensing (green): Converts photodiode signals into error signals for each DoF.   Mirror/Frequency Control (yellow): Converts errors into corrective signals.   Driving (orange): Simulates actual mirror actuation.   Laser (blue): Simulates laser frequency response.   Optickle (violet): Models optical response to all mirror and laser perturbations.   These modules together simulate the closed-loop noise propagation and are used to test new control strategies or predict future interferometer performance.     Study of the MICH Loop   The MICH control loop is responsible for stabilizing short-arm asymmetry.  For frequencies above 50 Hz, the loop is dominated by detection noise (electronic + shot noise).  Assuming this dominance, I was able to derive the injection transfer function \\(Y(f)\\) for the loop and validate the simulated model against actual interferometer data.  This confirmed the theoretical noise paths and highlighted where detection noise dominates the system.     Study of the SSFS Loop (Laser Frequency Stabilization)   The laser introduces phase noise, which is integrated from frequency fluctuations. Due to arm asymmetries (mirror reflectivity, thermal effects), this phase noise couples into the main gravitational wave signal channel.   The Second Stage Frequency Stabilization (SSFS) loop uses reflected optical signals at POP, measured via photodiode B4, to compute correction signals for the laser.   This loop is influenced by time-varying transfer functions due to thermal drifts and asymmetry fluctuations. To model this, I introduced time-dependent gains:      \\(F_{PC}(t)\\): Power Coupling Gain   \\(F_{TC}(t)\\): Transfer Coupling Gain   \\(Y(f, t)\\): Injection Transfer Function   These parameters were calibrated using broadband noise injections \\(N_{inj}\\) and validated at times \\(t_{inj}\\). The model was used to explain differences between simulated and real data in DARM.     Conclusion   The feedback control systems in the Virgo interferometer are essential for keeping the detector in its optimal operating state. By modeling the noise propagation through these loops, it’s possible to:      Identify dominant noise sources   Design more effective control strategies   Predict the sensitivity of future detectors   Through this work, I demonstrated that:      The MICH loop is dominated by detection noise above 50Hz.   The SSFS loop requires time-varying modeling due to asymmetries.   Overall, this project not only validated important theoretical models, but also highlighted remaining challenges, such as unexplained bias and underestimation of some residual noise sources.      Future work should investigate whether these mismatches originate from modeling assumptions, unmodeled loop couplings, or unknown noise mechanisms.

    "title": "PRINCESS: Predicting Gravitational-Wave Observations",
    "excerpt":"Overview of the PRINCESS Code   PRINCESS (Prediction of Compact Binaries Observations with Gravitational Waves) is an open-source Python tool that forecasts both individual gravitational-wave events and the stochastic background from unresolved sources.      Developed for use with second- and third-generation detectors (LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer)   Easy to install and use: includes ready-to-run templates and example configurations   Designed to be user-friendly and modular, suitable for researchers and students   Fully documented using Sphinx, with tutorials and examples available on GitHub     Gravitational Wave Detection Theory   Gravitational-wave detections rely on computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each event:   \\[\\rho^2 = 4 \\int_{f_{\\min}}^{f_{\\max}} \\frac{|\\tilde{h}(f)|^2}{S_n(f)} df\\]  Here, \\(\\tilde{h}(f)\\) is the Fourier-domain waveform, and \\(S_n(f)\\) is the detector noise power spectral density.

Detection Biases and Event Predictions   Detection requires a threshold (e.g., \\(\\rho &gt; 8\\)). PRINCESS takes into account the selection bias introduced by this threshold and forecasts the number of resolvable events per detector configuration.  See figure below:          The tool reproduces trends observed in real data. Overestimates are often due to optimistic merger rates or mass distributions in the input population models.     Merger Rates and Observational Comparisons   The tested models span a wide range of local merger rates \\(R_0\\) from 18 to 100 Gpc\\(^{-3}\\)yr\\(^{-1}\\), compared to the observed LVK value of \\(R_0 = 23.9^{+14.9}_{-8.6}\\).   Key findings:      Models with lower metallicity spread (σZ = 0.2) align better with current observations.   Mass distributions with an excess of high-mass black holes inflate SNR values and detection counts.     Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background   In addition to individual detections, unresolved sources generate a stochastic background. Its amplitude is quantified through the energy density spectrum:   \\[\\Omega_{\\mathrm{GW}}(f) = \\frac{f}{\\rho_c c} F(f)\\]  with \\(F(f)\\) the total GW flux and \\(\\rho_c\\) the Universe’s critical energy density.

Spectral Shape and Detectability          The typical \\(f^{2/3}\\) slope below ~200 Hz arises from the inspiral phase. High-frequency cutoffs reflect the end of the merger process. Spectral variations stem from different redshift and mass distributions.   PRINCESS also computes the background’s detectability (SNR), including cross-correlation across detectors.

    "title": "Search for anomalies in sinusoidal signals",
    "excerpt":"                                       This study stems from a personal curiosity about the implementation of autoencoders for anomaly detection in signal processing. This type of approach is already widely documented on Papers With Code; here are a few relevant references. For me, it’s also an opportunity to get hands-on experience in a new area of deep learning: autoencoders applied to time series, a topic I already understand well from a signal analysis perspective.           The goal of this study is to test the limits of autoencoder-based anomaly detection in time-series signals. Given the breadth of the topic, I limited the study to sinusoidal signals affected by Gaussian noise and drift noise, the latter being typical of wear in electronic components.   This post consists of three sections:     A summary of how autoencoders work, with the parameters used in this study.   The “step-by-step” training strategy to address the periodic nature of the signals.   A model evaluation on noisy signals with a controlled drift ratio.     AI Model   Basics of Autoencoders   An autoencoder is a type of neural network designed to reconstruct its input after compressing it into a lower-dimensional latent space. It has two parts:      The encoder: reduces the input dimensionality to extract its essential features.   The decoder: reconstructs the input from the compressed representation.   In unsupervised learning, an autoencoder can learn dominant patterns in the data. Any significant reconstruction error then indicates an anomaly (i.e., data that deviates from the learned patterns).   The standard loss function is the Mean Squared Error:   \\[\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\hat{x}_i)^2\\]  where \\(x_i\\) is the original data and \\(\\hat{x}_i\\) is its reconstruction.     My Model   The model used in this study is a 1D convolutional autoencoder designed for fixed-length time signals (500 samples). It consists of two main blocks: an encoder and a decoder, built from convolutional layers suited to time-structured data.   Encoder   The encoder transforms the input signal into a low-dimensional latent representation. It includes:   Three successive 1D convolutional layers with:      Increasing numbers of channels (16, 32, then 64),   A kernel size of 5,   A stride of 2 to progressively reduce temporal resolution,   A ReLU activation after each convolution.   The output is then flattened into a linear vector and passed through a fully connected layer to produce a latent embedding of predefined size (encoded_size).   Decoder   The decoder reconstructs the original signal from the latent representation. It mirrors the encoder:      A first fully connected layer reshapes the latent vector into a tensor suitable for the transposed convolutional layers.   Three transposed convolution layers:            They progressively increase the temporal resolution,       Reduce the number of channels from 64 → 32 → 16 → 1 (the original shape),       Each step is followed by a ReLU activation, except the last.           This architecture allows the model to learn to extract key features from the input signal and reconstruct them as faithfully as possible. Latent compression forces the autoencoder to filter noise and retain only essential information.   This model encodes 500-sample input signals into a latent space sized at 30% of the input, and reconstructs them via transposed convolutions. The architecture is intentionally compact to facilitate progressive learning of simple patterns.     Model Training   Training Data   Training is conducted on batches of 12,000 signals, each 500 samples long, fed in mini-batches of 32 to the GPU. Each signal is a noisy sinusoid, randomly generated according to the parameters defined for each training phase.     Step-by-Step Training Strategy   Training progresses through increasingly complex signal generations. The summary table is as follows:                  Step       Epochs       Amplitude       Phase       Frequency (Hz)       Noise                       1       10       4       0       0.05       None                 2       30       \\(\\mathcal{U}(3.5, 4.5)\\)       0       0.05       None                 3       30       \\(\\mathcal{U}(3.5, 4.5)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 0.5)\\)       0.05       None                 4       100       \\(\\mathcal{U}(3.5, 4.5)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 0.5)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0.025, 0.075)\\)       None                 5       100       \\(\\mathcal{U}(3.5, 4.5)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 0.5)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0.025, 0.075)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.05)\\)                 6       250       \\(\\mathcal{U}(2, 6)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 2π)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0.025, 0.225)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.05)\\)                 7       400       \\(\\mathcal{U}(2, 6)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0, 2π)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{U}(0.025, 0.225)\\)       \\(\\mathcal{N}(0, 0.25)\\)           A ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler dynamically adjusts the learning rate from an initial value of \\(10^{-4}\\), if validation loss plateaus.     Residual Noise   Due to the random nature of the added noise, perfect signal reconstruction is impossible. The final loss therefore stabilizes to a non-zero residual noise.   Assuming:   \\[\\text{signal}_{\\text{target}} = \\text{informative}_{signal} + \\text{random}_{noise}\\]  and perfect reconstruction of the informative part, the MSE becomes:   \\[\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n [(\\text{output} - \\text{target})^2] = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n [\\text{random}_{noise}^2]\\]  In this study:     Steps 4–6: residual noise ≈ 0.0025   Step 7: residual noise ≈ 0.0625      Blue : Validation loss evolution across the different training steps described on the previous table. Red : Learning rate evolution across the training. The grey zone represents the theoretical limits the model cannot overtake.     Evaluation and Testing on Noisy Signals   Model Evaluation   The model is evaluated on 10,000 new signals generated with the parameters of Step 7.  Observed median loss:   \\[\\text{MSE}_{\\text{test}} = 0.078^{+0.053}_{-0.012}\\]  This is compatible with residual noise, indicating good generalization capacity.     Drift Noise   A drift component was added to the signals:      Drift is a slow and continuous signal shift over time. It can be modeled with an affine function:    \\[\\text{drift}(t) = \\alpha \\cdot t\\]  where \\(\\alpha\\) is the drift coefficient.     Examples of drifted signals and their reconstruction for various values of \\(\\alpha\\).     Anomaly Detection   The model fails to reconstruct signals containing unseen drift, as expected. For each drift ratio, the loss is compared to evaluation percentiles:      OK: MSE &lt; 95ᵗʰ percentile   WARNING: 95ᵗʰ percentile &lt; MSE &lt; max   ANOMALY: MSE &gt; max (evaluation)   To quantify detection threshold, we define the Noise ratio :   \\[\\text{Noise ratio} = \\frac{\\text{total}_{drift}}{\\text{residual}_{error}}\\]  The model detects anomalies as soon as the noise ratio reaches 1.6, which shows high sensitivity. This could be improved by increasing signal length.      Performance for drift signal reconstitution for various values of \\(\\alpha\\).     Conclusion   Autoencoders prove effective for detecting anomalies in sinusoidal signals contaminated by Gaussian noise and drift. The method is particularly sensitive to gradual deviations, as long as their amplitude exceeds the residual noise.   Next steps:     Use longer signals to detect subtler drift.   Explore other waveform types: triangular signals, Heaviside functions, etc.   Test the hypothesis that training difficulties stem from the zero-mean nature of sinusoids — e.g., by adding an offset.   This project is a proof-of-concept on simulated data. It would be relevant to test this approach on real-world data to assess its industrial potential.

    "title": "Black Hole Spin Evolution and Model Selection from GWTC-3",
    "excerpt":"The Challenge: What Sets Black Hole Spins?   Understanding black hole (BH) spins is critical for unveiling the physics of massive stellar evolution and binary interactions. Spins encode how angular momentum is transported within progenitor stars and can be influenced by binary interactions, tidal forces, and supernova kicks. However, the physical mechanisms regulating these processes remain uncertain.   This project confronts several theoretical models with gravitational-wave observations to determine which best explain the observed spin distribution of merging binary black holes (BBHs).     Competing Models of Angular Momentum Transport   We explore four toy models that represent a broad range of assumptions on internal angular momentum transport:      GENEVA (G): Inefficient transport via meridional currents and shear (low spin dissipation).   MESA (M): Efficient transport using Tayler–Spruit dynamo (moderate spins).   FULLER (F): Extremely efficient magnetic transport, resulting in nearly vanishing spins (χ ≈ 0.01).   MAXWELLIAN (Max): A phenomenological model with spins drawn from a Maxwellian distribution (σ = 0.1), empirically motivated.   Each model is also tested with an added tidal spin-up mechanism for the second-born black hole, following Bavera et al. (2020)—referred to as _B21 variants.     Tidal Spin-Up in Wolf–Rayet Stars: The _B21 Prescription   In tight binaries, the progenitor of the second-born BH may be a Wolf–Rayet (WR) star that is tidally spun up before collapse. The B21 model provides a fit for the final BH spin as a function of the WR mass and orbital period.   This mechanism is critical for models like FULLER or MESA, where most BHs would otherwise have negligible spin. Including B21 enables a small sub-population of highly spinning BHs, reconciling models with non-zero spin observations.     Observational Spin Parameters   Gravitational-wave detectors provide access to two spin observables:      Effective spin (χ_eff): The mass-weighted projection of individual spins along the orbital angular momentum.   Precessing spin (χ_p): A proxy for spin components misaligned with the orbit, responsible for precession.   These observables are compared across models using distributions extracted from hierarchical population synthesis simulations.   Figure 2: Mass Distribution   The model mass distributions are relatively insensitive to spin assumptions. However, kick models affect the mass peaks. The GM20 model shows more low-mass mergers due to its lower kicks preserving wider binaries, while σ150 and σ265 suppress low-mass systems through disruptions.   Figure 4: Spin Distributions         GENEVA models peak at high spins.   FULLER yields spins near zero — strongly disfavored unless B21 is included.   MESA and MAX exhibit intermediate behavior.   Including B21 raises χ_p and χ_eff, especially in models with otherwise low spins.      Figure 5: Model Likelihoods   Bayesian Analysis Framework   The model comparison is performed using hierarchical Bayesian inference. The likelihood of each model is computed using the spin and mass posteriors from 59 BBH events in GWTC-3. The analysis includes:      Marginalization over 5 parameters: {chirp mass, mass ratio, redshift, χ_eff, χ_p}   A population prior from binary population synthesis with metallicity and star-formation history   Kernel density estimation for constructing continuous model predictions   Likelihoods are normalized with respect to detection biases, ensuring proper comparison with LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations.       Log-likelihood values demonstrate that:      FULLER (F) is rejected unless the B21 spin-up mechanism is included.   MAX and MESA_B21 are among the most compatible with GWTC-3 data.   The precessing spin parameter χ_p is crucial for discriminating between models.     Key Results      Models predicting only negligible spins (e.g., FULLER without B21) are ruled out.   A sub-population of tidally spun-up BHs (via B21) is sufficient to match observations.   Spin orientation (χ_p) contains crucial information: ignoring χ_p significantly weakens the constraints.   Models with efficient angular momentum transport (e.g., MESA + B21) offer the best match.   Low natal kick models (GM20) underperform due to their prediction of too many aligned, low-χ_p systems.     Why It Matters   This analysis provides the first comprehensive test of spin magnitude models using hierarchical Bayesian inference and real gravitational-wave data. The findings support:      Efficient internal angular momentum transport (as in the Tayler–Spruit model),   Tidal spin-up mechanisms in close WR binaries,   The necessity of spin precession measurements to break degeneracies between astrophysical scenarios.   As more precessing systems are detected, we will be able to refine these constraints and further resolve the origin of black hole spins.

    "excerpt":"To introduce my research work, I present it through three broader, popular-science-oriented sections. These allow a general contextualization of the scientific projects I have had the pleasure of conducting throughout my career. You will find three main topics:      Gravitational waves and their detection   The origin of black holes   (Upcoming content)   This first page is dedicated to gravitational waves, offering an overview of the field and introducing my related research projects.     A Brief Historical Introduction   Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime that propagate at the speed of light. They are a direct consequence of Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity, formulated in 1915 in two foundational papers:     “On the General Theory of Relativity”   “The Field Equations of Gravitation”   The first publication explicitly describing gravitational waves—“Über Gravitationswellen” (1918)—appeared three years later.     Abstract of the original 1918 article by Albert Einstein   In 1974, Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor discovered the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16—two orbiting stellar remnants, one of which is a pulsar emitting regular light pulses. In 1979, after four years of observation, they demonstrated that the orbital decay of the system matched the predictions of general relativity, thus confirming the existence of gravitational waves indirectly (1979 publication). They were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993.  A 2016 update to this work is available here.     Orbital decay of the binary pulsar system. Red points are measurements, closely matching the theoretical curve predicted by general relativity.   The first direct detection of gravitational waves occurred in 2015—exactly 100 years after general relativity. Using the LIGO detectors, scientists observed the merger of two black holes (29 and 36 solar masses).  (Original paper)   In 2017, the Virgo detector in Europe joined the LIGO network, enabling triangulation of gravitational wave sources. On August 17, 2017, the network observed the merger of two neutron stars, simultaneously with electromagnetic signals, marking the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy.     Detection paper   Multi-messenger analysis   The foundational detection (GW150914) was recognized with the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics.   As of 2025, the global network includes four detectors: two in the U.S. (LIGO), one in Italy (Virgo), and one in Japan (KAGRA). Together, they have recorded over 100 black hole mergers, enriching our understanding of the universe’s structure and evolution.     Ground-Based Gravitational Wave Detectors   At the time of writing, four operational ground-based interferometers exist:      LIGO Livingston and LIGO Hanford (USA) – each with 4 km-long arms   Virgo (Italy) – 3 km-long arms   KAGRA (Japan) – a 3 km-long underground interferometer      How These Detectors Work   Gravitational waves slightly stretch and squeeze spacetime. On Earth, this is measured using giant Michelson interferometers with kilometer-scale arms. The principle involves detecting phase shifts in laser beams bouncing between mirrors at the ends of the arms. A passing wave causes a tiny differential change in path length, producing interference patterns that can be measured.                 Click the image to watch the explicative video on YouTube    Operating Point of an Interferometer   Interferometers are tuned to operate on a dark fringe, meaning destructive interference cancels the signal at the output. This requires real-time feedback control of mirror positions to maintain stability.  In this section, I present my research on modeling and simulating these feedback control loops to keep the interferometer at its operating point.    Explore Noise Analysis    The Future of Ground-Based Detectors   Two major next-generation projects are currently underway:   Cosmic Explorer (USA)   The Cosmic Explorer collaboration proposes building two new interferometers with arm lengths of 20 to 40 km, dramatically improving sensitivity. This would allow detection of nearly all compact binary mergers in the observable universe.  🔗 Cosmic Explorer website  🖼️ Insert CE image here   Einstein Telescope (Europe)   Europe is preparing the Einstein Telescope (ET), possibly built at one or two sites. Multiple design and location options are still under study.  My work explores the scientific impact of design choices on compact binary detection rates and broader scientific potential.     ET official site   Design impact study (2023)   ET Blue Book (2025)    Explore Science with ET     Pulsar Timing Arrays   Another method of detecting gravitational waves is by monitoring millisecond pulsars. These highly regular signals can exhibit arrival time delays if spacetime is distorted by a passing gravitational wave. By comparing dozens of pulsars, it’s possible to reveal such distortions.   In June 2023, the NANOGrav collaboration announced evidence of a gravitational wave background, possibly generated by supermassive black hole binaries or a population of such systems.  🔗 NANOGrav discovery paper     Space-Based Interferometers   LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) is an ambitious project led by ESA in collaboration with NASA.  It will consist of three spacecraft placed in a triangle formation orbiting around the Lagrange Point L2, with arms stretching 2.5 million kilometers. This enables exploration of low-frequency gravitational waves, inaccessible from the ground.     ","url": "https://pigouette.github.io/Pigouette.github.io/gravitational-waves/binary-blak-holes"
