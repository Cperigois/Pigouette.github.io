## A Fast and Scalable Code to Explore the Gravitational-Wave Background

**Princess** is a Python-based code developed to model the gravitational-wave background produced by the population of compact binary mergers ‚Äî including binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and mixed systems (BHNS).  

It was designed to answer a growing need in the gravitational-wave community: the ability to quickly generate synthetic background signals across a wide range of astrophysical scenarios, detector sensitivities, and subtraction strategies. It is open-source and documented to promote reproducibility and collaboration.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Princess was built around three main objectives: **speed**, **flexibility**, and **realism**.

- üîÅ **Fast generation of population catalogs** using Monte Carlo sampling of binary parameters.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible modeling** of astrophysical assumptions: merger rates, mass/spin distributions, metallicity evolution, delay times, etc.
- üéØ **Realistic observability filters** to separate resolved and unresolved sources, supporting signal subtraction studies.
- üîâ **Spectral computation of gravitational-wave energy density** across frequency, including residual backgrounds.
- üî¨ **Support for detector network configurations** (e.g. ET, CE, LIGO, Virgo), using instrument sensitivity curves and overlap reduction functions.

## Applications and Scientific Goals

Princess was used in several published studies to assess the capabilities of current and future detectors to:

- Constrain **compact binary formation channels** via the spectral features of the gravitational-wave background;
- Detect or place limits on the background from **Population III remnants**;
- Evaluate the impact of **binary subtraction techniques** on the detectability of stochastic signals;
- Compare different **detector designs** (e.g. triangle vs. dual L-shapes in Einstein Telescope).

Its performance allows researchers to explore large parameter spaces efficiently, and to simulate observational scenarios under varying model uncertainties.
